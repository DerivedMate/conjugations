{- 
  addresses an error, as perceived, of `intersect` returning `"fallecer" `intersect` "fallezco" == "fallece"`; 
  instead, returns "fallec", for "fallezco" only contains one 'e', whereas the result contains two.
  Deprecated, for it fails when one of the sets still contains duplicates of a certain common element after the other set is already exhausted. Example: `intersect' "fuere" "fuÃ©remos"`
